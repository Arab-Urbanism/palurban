The 'infrastructural turn' has specific salience in Middle East studies, specifically how infrastructure assembles relations of power as well as dissent and connects the space of the Middle East to global circuits of circulation and colonialism. Nowhere is salience more acutely articulated than in Palestine, where everyday infrastructures (and their failures) intersect with the settler-colonial, humanitarian, developmental and segregation infrastructures. From transport, logistics and checkpoints to waste and connectivity contestations on infrastructure indeed assemble political life.
